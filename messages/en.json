    "questions": [
      {
        "q": "What is AI Search Optimization?",
        "a": "AI Search Optimization (also called LLM SEO or GEO) is the practice of optimizing your business information so that AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Google's AI can accurately find, understand, and recommend your business to users."
      },
      {
        "q": "How is this different from traditional SEO?",
        "a": "Traditional SEO focuses on Google's search algorithm. AI Search Optimization focuses on how large language models (LLMs) perceive and cite your business. While there's overlap, AI systems use different data sources and prioritize structured, authoritative information differently."
      },
      {
        "q": "How do you measure AI visibility?",
        "a": "We run systematic tests asking various AI assistants about businesses in your industry and location. We track whether your business is mentioned, how accurately it's described, and whether it's recommended. We provide detailed reports showing your visibility score over time."
      },
      {
        "q": "How long until I see results?",
        "a": "Initial improvements in citation accuracy can be seen within 2-4 weeks. Significant improvements in AI recommendation rates typically take 2-3 months as AI systems update their knowledge bases and our citation building takes effect."
      },
      {
        "q": "Do you work with businesses outside Switzerland?",
        "a": "Currently we're focused on Swiss businesses, particularly in German and French-speaking regions. We plan to expand to other European markets in 2025."
